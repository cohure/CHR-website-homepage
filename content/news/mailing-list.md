On behalf of the CHR board, we are pleased to announce that we are setting up a mailing list for the CHR community. This will allow the board to share important updates with all members, and it will also enable community members to circulate relevant vacancies, calls, and other announcements.

We are using Google Groups for this. You can join the Group using either a Gmail address or your institutional/work email address. In the latter case, please note that you need to link that address to a Google account before joining. More information on how to do this can be found on [this page](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205?hl=en) and via the links at the bottom of that page.

We are aware that Google Groups is not a fully independent platform, and at some point we may migrate to a more sustainable alternative; should we do so, we will of course inform the community well in advance.

You can join the CHR mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/chr-mailing). We will accept your request as soon as possible.
