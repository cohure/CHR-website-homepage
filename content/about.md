The Computational Humanities Research (CHR) Society is an international and interdisciplinary community that brings together researchers with an interest in computational approaches to the humanities. Founded during the COVID-19 pandemic, CHR has grown from virtual beginnings to a vibrant organization hosting annual conferences across Europe, including [Antwerp (2022)](https://2022.computational-humanities-research.org/), [Paris (2023)](https://2023.computational-humanities-research.org/), and [Aarhus (2024)](https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org/).

The arts and humanities landscape has undergone a significant transformation with the rising adoption of computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches. This emerging research paradigm employs formal methods and explicit computational models—ranging from quantitative analysis techniques to sophisticated data processing methods—while also engaging in critical theoretical reflection on these approaches.
Recognizing that scholars working at this intersection often lacked suitable venues to present and publish computational work that remains grounded in traditional humanities inquiry, CHR has established itself as a dedicated home for this interdisciplinary scholarship. We provide a specialized platform where innovative computational approaches and rigorous humanities research converge, fostering methodological advancement while honoring disciplinary traditions.

The CHR community is dedicated to:
<ul class="styled-list">
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight:600;">Building a community of scholars</span> working on humanities research questions using a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches. We consider this community complementary to the digital humanities landscape and actively welcome people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities, including scholars from underrepresented groups and those contributing novel perspectives to computational humanities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight:600;">Promoting good practices</span> through sharing "research stories," such as publishing code and data to support transparency and replication, pre-registering research designs, and redesigning review processes for interdisciplinary computational studies relevant to the humanities.
    </li>
</ul>

Led by a dedicated [board](/board) with specialized officers overseeing areas such as diversity and inclusion, social media, and publications, CHR is committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all members while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.
Join us in advancing computational approaches to humanities research and be part of our growing community.
